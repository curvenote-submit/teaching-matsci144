Human civilization emits millions of tons of CO₂ into Earth's atmosphere every year. 
Natural processes which reduce atmospheric CO{sub}`2` concentration include:
- Dissolution in sea water.
- Incorporation into the terrestrial biosphere, especially forests and grasslands. 
- Weathering of silicate rocks.
- Accumulation of organic material under anaerobic conditions such as in wetlands or peat bogs. 

Unfortunately, these natural processes cannot keep pace with the CO₂ released by human industrial, transportation and agricultural production. The net result has been a consistent rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration over the past few hundred years, shown in [](#co2_atmosphere).

This timescale of this recent CO₂ is extremely rapid compared to the geological timescales of previous CO₂ oscillations.
